}
\arguments{
\item{siteDir}{Directory containing website. Defaults to current
working directory.}

\item{siteName}{Name for the site (names must be unique within
an account). Defaults to the base name of the specified siteDir,
(or to a name provided by a custom site generation function).}

\item{account, server}{Uniquely identify a remote server with either your
user \code{account}, the \code{server} name, or both. Use \code{\link[=accounts]{accounts()}} to see the
full list of available options.}

\item{render}{Rendering behavior for site: "none" to upload a
static version of the current contents of the site directory;
"local" to render the site locally then upload it; "server" to
render the site on the server. Note that for "none" and "local"
R scripts (.R) and markdown documents (.Rmd and .md) will not be
uploaded to the server.}

\item{launch.browser}{If true, the system's default web browser will be
launched automatically after the app is started. Defaults to \code{TRUE} in
interactive sessions only. If a function is passed, it will be called
after the app is started, with the app URL as a paramter.}

\item{logLevel}{One of \code{"quiet"}, \code{"normal"} or \code{"verbose"}; indicates how
much logging to the console is to be performed. At \code{"quiet"} reports no
information; at \code{"verbose"}, a full diagnostic log is captured.}

\item{lint}{Lint the project before initiating deployment, to identify
potentially problematic code?}

\item{metadata}{Additional metadata fields to save with the deployment
record. These fields will be returned on subsequent calls to
\code{\link[=deployments]{deployments()}}.}

\item{python}{Full path to a python binary for use by \code{reticulate}.
Required if \code{reticulate} is a dependency of the app being deployed.
If python = NULL, and RETICULATE_PYTHON or RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK is
set in the environment, its value will be used. The specified python binary
will be invoked to determine its version and to list the python packages
installed in the environment.}

\item{recordDir}{The default, \code{NULL}, uses \code{siteDir}, since this is usually
where you want to record the deployment data.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \code{\link[=deployApp]{deployApp()}}. Do not supply \code{appDir}
or \code{appFiles}; these three parameters are automatically generated by
\code{deploySite}.}
