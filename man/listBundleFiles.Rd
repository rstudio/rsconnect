\title{List Files to be Bundled}
\usage{
listBundleFiles(appDir)
}
\arguments{
\item{appDir}{Directory containing the application.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing the following elements:

\tabular{ll}{
\code{contents} \tab A list of the files to be bundled \cr
\code{totalSize} \tab The total size of the files \cr
}
}
\description{
Given a directory containing an application, returns the names of the files
to be bundled in the application.
}
\details{
This function computes results similar to a recursive directory
listing from \code{\link[=list.files]{list.files()}}, with the following constraints:

\enumerate{
\item{If the total size of the files exceeds the maximum bundle size, no
more files are listed. The maximum bundle size is controlled by the
\code{rsconnect.max.bundle.size} option.}
\item{If the total size number of files exceeds the maximum number to be
bundled, no more files are listed. The maximum number of files in the
bundle is controlled by the \code{rsconnect.max.bundle.files} option.}
\item{Certain files and folders that don't need to be bundled, such as
those containing internal version control and RStudio state, are
excluded.}
\item{In order to stop specific files in the working directory from being
listed in the bundle, the files must be listed in the .rscignore file.
This file must have one file or directory per line with no support for
wildcards.}
}
}
