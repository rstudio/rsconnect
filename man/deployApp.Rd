\arguments{
\item{appDir}{Directory containing application. Defaults to current working
directory.}

\item{appFiles}{The files and directories to bundle and deploy (only if
\code{upload = TRUE}). Can be \code{NULL}, in which case all the files in the
directory containing the application are bundled, with the exception of
any listed in an \code{.rscignore} file. Takes precedence over
\code{appFileManifest} if both are supplied.}

\item{appFileManifest}{An alternate way to specify the files to be deployed;
a file containing the names of the files, one per line, relative to the
\code{appDir}.}

\item{appPrimaryDoc}{If the application contains more than one document, this
parameter indicates the primary one, as a path relative to \code{appDir}. Can be
\code{NULL}, in which case the primary document is inferred from the contents
being deployed.}

\item{appSourceDoc}{If the application is composed of static files (e.g
HTML), this parameter indicates the source document, if any, as a fully
qualified path. Deployment information returned by \code{\link[=deployments]{deployments()}} is
associated with the source document.}

\item{appName}{Name of application (names must be unique within an account).
Defaults to the base name of the specified \code{appDir}.}

\item{appTitle}{Free-form descriptive title of application. Optional; if
supplied, will often be displayed in favor of the name. When deploying a
new application, you may supply only the \code{appTitle} to receive an
auto-generated \code{appName}.}

\item{appId}{If updating an application, the ID of the application being
updated. Optional unless updating an app owned by another user.}

\item{contentCategory}{Optional; the kind of content being deployed (e.g.
\code{"plot"} or \code{"site"}).}

\item{account}{Account to deploy application to. This parameter is only
required for the initial deployment of an application when there are
multiple accounts configured on the system (see \link{accounts}).}

\item{server}{Server name. Required only if you use the same account name on
multiple servers.}

\item{upload}{If \code{TRUE} (the default) then the application is uploaded from
the local system prior to deployment. If \code{FALSE} then it is re-deployed
using the last version that was uploaded. \code{FALSE} is only supported on
shinyapps.io; \code{TRUE} is required on Posit Connect.}

\item{recordDir}{Directory where publish record is written. Can be \code{NULL}
in which case record will be written to the location specified with \code{appDir}.}

\item{launch.browser}{If true, the system's default web browser will be
launched automatically after the app is started. Defaults to \code{TRUE} in
interactive sessions only. If a function is passed, it will be called
after the app is started, with the app URL as a paramter.}

\item{on.failure}{Function to be called if the deployment fails. If a
deployment log URL is available, it's passed as a parameter.}

\item{logLevel}{One of \code{"quiet"}, \code{"normal"} or \code{"verbose"}; indicates how
much logging to the console is to be performed. At \code{"quiet"} reports no
information; at \code{"verbose"}, a full diagnostic log is captured.}

\item{lint}{Lint the project before initiating deployment, to identify
potentially problematic code?}

\item{metadata}{Additional metadata fields to save with the deployment
record. These fields will be returned on subsequent calls to
\code{\link[=deployments]{deployments()}}.}

\item{forceUpdate}{If \code{TRUE}, update any previously-deployed app without
asking. If \code{FALSE}, ask to update. If unset, defaults to the value of
\code{getOption("rsconnect.force.update.apps", FALSE)}.}

\item{python}{Full path to a python binary for use by \code{reticulate}.
Required if \code{reticulate} is a dependency of the app being deployed.
If python = NULL, and RETICULATE_PYTHON or RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK is
set in the environment, its value will be used. The specified python binary
will be invoked to determine its version and to list the python packages
installed in the environment.}

\item{forceGeneratePythonEnvironment}{Optional. If an existing
\code{requirements.txt} file is found, it will be overwritten when this argument
is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{quarto}{Optional. Full path to a Quarto binary for use deploying Quarto
content. The provided Quarto binary will be used to run \verb{quarto inspect}
to gather information about the content.}

\item{appVisibility}{One of \code{NULL}, "private"\verb{, or }"public"\verb{; the visibility of the deployment. When }NULL`, no change to visibility is
made. Currently has an effect only on deployments to shinyapps.io.}

\item{image}{Optional. The name of the image to use when building and
executing this content. If none is provided, Posit Connect will
attempt to choose an image based on the content requirements.}
