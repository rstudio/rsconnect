\item{appDir}{Directory containing application. Defaults to current working
directory.}

\item{appName}{Name of application (names must be unique within an account).
If not supplied on the first deploy, it will be generated from the base
name of \code{appDir} and \code{appTitle}, if supplied. On subsequent deploys,
it will use the previously stored value.}

user \code{account}, the \code{server} name, or both. Use \code{\link[=accounts]{accounts()}} to see the
full list of available options.}

\item{from}{Date range starting timestamp (Unix timestamp or relative time
delta such as "2d" or "3w").}

\item{until}{Date range ending timestamp (Unix timestamp or relative time
delta such as "2d" or "3w").}

\item{interval}{Summarization interval. Data points at intervals less then this
will be grouped. (Relative time delta e.g. "120s" or "1h" or "30d").}
