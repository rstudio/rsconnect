\arguments{
\item{appDir}{Directory containing the content (Shiny application, R Markdown
document, etc).}

\item{appFiles}{Optional. The full set of files and directories to be
included in future deployments of this content. Used when computing
dependency requirements. When \code{NULL}, all files in \code{appDir} are considered.}

directory containing more than one. If \code{NULL}, the primary document is
inferred from the file list.}

\item{contentCategory}{Optional. Specifies the kind of content being deployed
(e.g. \code{"plot"} or \code{"site"}).}

\item{python}{Optional. Full path to a Python binary for use by \code{reticulate}.
The specified Python binary will be invoked to determine its version and to
list the Python packages installed in the environment. If \code{python = NULL},
and \code{RETICULATE_PYTHON} is set in the environment, its value will be used.}

\item{forceGeneratePythonEnvironment}{Optional. If an existing
\code{requirements.txt} file is found, it will be overwritten when this argument
is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{quarto}{Optional. Full path to a Quarto binary for use deploying Quarto
content. The provided Quarto binary will be used to run \verb{quarto inspect}
to gather information about the content.}

\item{image}{Optional. The name of the image to use when building and
executing this content. If none is provided, Posit Connect will
attempt to choose an image based on the content requirements.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints progress messages to the console}
