title: "rmarkdown with bad link case"
---

One of the embedded images uses `rstudio.svg` even though the on-disk filename
is `RStudio.svg`. This will render fine on a Mac, for example, but will err
when rendered on Linux.

The Mac filesystem is case-preserving, but case-insensitive. The Linux
filesystem is case-sensitive.

The IDE and `rsconnect::deployDoc` attempt to deploy the as-linked filenames.
With both `rstudio.svg` and `RStudio.svg` links, the bundle has two copies of
the SVG!

You can use `rsconnect::deployApp` directly to see the lint error in the R
console:

```r
rsconnect::deployApp(
  appDir = getwd(), 
  appFiles = c("index.Rmd", "RStudio.svg"))
```

And now, the links!

This one (line 29) is all lower-case and should trigger the error.

![](rstudio.svg)

This one is mixed-case and matches the on-disk filename.
